                    <p><b>Rock paper scissors</b> (also known by other orderings of the three items, with "rock" sometimes being called "stone") 
                        is a hand game, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an 
                        outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger 
                        and middle finger extended, forming a V). "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign (also indicating "victory" or "peace") 
                        except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air.
                    </p>
                    <p>Rock paper scissors is often used as a fair choosing method between two people, similar to coin flipping, drawing straws, 
                    or throwing dice in order to settle a dispute or make an unbiased group decision. Unlike truly random selection methods, however, 
                    <mark>rock paper scissors can be played with a degree of skill by recognizing and exploiting non-random behavior in opponents</mark>.
